# ConvNets-Architectures
Learning About Convolutional Neural Network Architectures via Machine Learning Tokyo Deep learning workshop on Convolutional Neural Nets. This repo summarizes my progress

## My Progress:

- I have replicated some of the neural network architectures i learnt about
- I compiled the networks into a single python script so I can easily use any of them for any purpose in future by simply calling them.
- I wrote a tiny function called visualize_model to visualize the graph of the network (nothing special, still a work in progress, not sure it'd properly work without jupyter notebooks at the moment)
- Simly documenting my journey!!
